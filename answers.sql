### Question 1 Achieving 1NF (First Normal Form) üõ†Ô∏è
Task:
- You are given the following table **ProductDetail**:

| OrderID | CustomerName  | Products                        |
|---------|---------------|---------------------------------|
| 101     | John Doe      | Laptop, Mouse                   |
| 102     | Jane Smith    | Tablet, Keyboard, Mouse         |
| 103     | Emily Clark   | Phone                           |


- In the table above, the **Products column** contains multiple values, which violates **1NF**.
- **Write an SQL query** to transform this table into **1NF**, ensuring that each row represents a single product for an order

--- 
  Answer: SELECT OrderID, CustomerName, UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(Products, ', ')) AS Product FROM Orders;


### Question 2 Achieving 2NF (Second Normal Form) üß©

- You are given the following table **OrderDetails**, which is already in **1NF** but still contains partial dependencies:
  Answer: OrderDetails table is already in 1NF but still contains partial dependencies, that means  it violates 2NF (Second Normal Form)

| OrderID | CustomerName  | Product      | Quantity |
|---------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| 101     | John Doe      | Laptop       | 2        |
| 101     | John Doe      | Mouse        | 1        |
| 102     | Jane Smith    | Tablet       | 3        |
| 102     | Jane Smith    | Keyboard     | 1        |
| 102     | Jane Smith    | Mouse        | 2        |
| 103     | Emily Clark   | Phone        | 1        |

- In the table above, the **CustomerName** column depends on **OrderID** (a partial dependency), which violates **2NF**. 

- Write an SQL query to transform this table into **2NF** by removing partial dependencies. Ensure that each non-key column fully depends on the entire primary key.
Answer: #First create the tables separately
  CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
# Insert information inside
  INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, CustomerName)
SELECT DISTINCT OrderID, CustomerName FROM OrderDetails;

#Create the second table 
  CREATE TABLE OrderItems (
    OrderID INT,
    Product VARCHAR(255),
    Quantity INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID, Product),
    FOREIGN KEY (OrderID) REFERENCES Orders(OrderID) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
#Insert information inside 
  INSERT INTO OrderItems (OrderID, Product, Quantity)
SELECT OrderID, Product, Quantity FROM OrderDetails;

Note: Now 2NF compliance is established , as CustomerName is now fully dependent on OrderID and not partially on a composite key.
